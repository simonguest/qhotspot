QHotspot
========
QHotspot is a home screen widget that makes it easy to turn on and off the wireless hotspot functionality on your smartphone. QHotspot turns on and off your hotspot in one click vs. having to go into Settings/Hotspot and Tethering, etc.

QHotspot is a shortcut to existing hotspot functionality - and does not enable or unlock hotspot functionality on devices that have been locked or don't support this.
